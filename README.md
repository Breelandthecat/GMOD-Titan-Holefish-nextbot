To install this, Extract the file to C:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\ or wherever you have your gmod addons folder. Make sure it makes a folder named BZTH in there after extracting it.

And btw, if you have garrys mod somewhere else than the C:, Type the drive letter, For example, I Have garrys mod on a drive with the letter F:, so for me the path to the addons folder is F:\Steamlibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\. Replace the F with the drive letter of your drive that contains your install of garrys mod.
